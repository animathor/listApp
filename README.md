# Listo
Step by step. Focus on what you can do.

* Create a to-do list using task-type item.
* Add subitems to any level's item.
* Sortable and Movable subitems in the same list.
* You can collect lists into collections (folders) which are also displayed in hierarchical structure.
* Collections and lists are also movable.
